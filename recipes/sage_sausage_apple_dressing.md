## Ingredients
- 1/2 C mirin (or white wine)
- 14 oz boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch chunks
- 1/2 onion, sliced thin

- 6 large eggs, beaten

### To make the Dashi substitute
- 6 oz stock
- 2 oz Worcesterchire sauce
- 2 oz fish sauce
- 1 oz soy sauce
- 1 oz rice vinegar

## Instructions
1. Add the dashi subsitute and mirin to a large skillet and simmer over medium heat.
2. Add the chicken and cook until it just loses its pink color, about 2-3 minutes.
3. Add the onion and scallions and cook until the chicken is fully cooked.
4. Turn heat down to medium-low. While slowly stirring, slowly pour the beaten eggs into the skillet. You will want to keep the mixture as smooth as possible.
